They fought and lost to Rome like the rest, scattering along with the rest of the natives. \n\nThroughout the years since they have honed their skills as archers, favouring short bows for close engagements.

Over the generations, a cast of Futanari emerged with heritage between romans, saxons, celts and norse. Whilst they struggle to find acceptance within their homelands, they are all accepting of one another. \n\nDue to the origin of their bloodlines, these Futanari are especially prone to their urges, but they prefer to unleash their passions on each other."

 tales_of_nog_tradition_desc: "Tír na nÓg is a mythical land of bounty, everlasting youth and magic that has been connected to Ireland in the past. According to the legend, a Futanari known as Milandria was taken to Tír na nÓg on the back of a golden boar that rode her across a bridge of SunLight. Whilst there, Milandria frolicked amongst the fae. She exchanged stories about the struggles of the mortal world and the fae who only knew joy were heart touched. They gave her a set of enchanted bracers that were said to ensure the path she walked would always be with bounty. She spent a long time partying in the land of Mag Mell. Partying and fucking. She found herself desiring to show her children the land of her birth. The Fae warned her that they should not tarry for long, and should Milandria touch foot on the earth the path back would become sealed forever. And so she rode the golden Boar back to Ireland with her children in tow. It had changed a great deal, the passage of time felt slow in Tír na nÓg. Whilst riding through the tree’s it is said Milandria caught a glimpse of the most beautiful woman to ever live. In her daze, she was knocked off the boar by a branch. The legend states that her last words to her children were to find that woman, before she turned to stone."

Nemain’s chaotic nature was imbued within their loins, causing the Futanari to gain access to a slither of her immense power at the cost of losing their senses. Badb therefore would choose to watch over the Futanari in battle, a crow flying overhead, sparing the bravest of Futanari from a mindless death. \n\nSo high was the position in which the Morrígan held the Futanari, that it is even said she had birthed some.

Despite her prior protesting, this Bog Blaster is loving the way you are treating her soggy hole. A creamy mixture of soil and cum rapidly spreads from the tip of her cock, your prostate examination frequently causing ropes of her tadpoles to splash into the mixture. \n\nThen, one of your many thrusts suddenly rocks your world. You stop, clenching on the Bog Blaster’s ass subconsciously as you keel over and unleash a fat load of cum up her asshole."

 nog_events.9006.desc:0 "You eagerly cup her large, round testicles in your hand and grope them greedily as if they were a pair of grain bags for you to squeeze. The Bog’s Blaster quickly hardens to an impressive size, throbbing precum into the dirt. Your technique is evidently quite effective. \n\n”You got magic hands you do!” Someone is pleased, but this is supposed to be #EMP for you!#! To help remind the Milandrite you flip her onto her back, allowing her pole to reach for the sky as you position yourself on top. Your fingers guide her moist glans to your wet entrances, but instead of taking her in you instead start gyrating your hips around her tip. \n\nAs this goes on, a steady stream of precum lubricates your toy’s stick for you. The owner however, is red in the face. Hands twitching with sexual frustration. #EMP Desperate#! eyes pleading with yours to proceed, As fun as this is, you are getting pretty desperate yourself. \n\nYou slam down onto her fat girlcock, failing to bottom out as your mind gets spiked with pleasure from the girth. The Bog Blaster throws her head back into the mud and moans uncontrollably. \n\n”Oh Mama! Looks like I’ll be joining ya in heaven soon!” \n\nUsually riding through wetlands is not recommended, but you are doing a pretty good job at it. The Bog Blaster is enslaved by her senses, forced to endure the pleasure you enact upon her penis as you rapidly bounce up and down her shaft. #EMP FUCK!!! UUUUUURRGRHH!!!#! \n\nYou orgasm mid thrust around the centre of her shaft, creaming it in your juices as  you twitch all over it. The sight of you losing your mind sets your partner off as well, exploding like a volcano into your pussy and sharing her bounty with you."
